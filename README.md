This is a repo for all of my configuration files. Anyone can use this if they would like but it's not designed to be useful for others.

## VIM

Setup VIM with symbolic links.

```sh
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vim/ ~/.vim
ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Point git to the repo files in `.gitconfig`:

```
[include]
    path = "~/.dotfiles/gitconfig"

[core]
    excludesfile = "~/.dotfiles/gitignore"
```

For shells.

## Emacs Doom

```
ln -s ~/dotfiles/doom.d ~/.doom.d
```

### zsh

Clone the antigen repo and source the zshrc file in `~/.zshrc`

```sh
curl -L git.io/antigen > ~/.antigen.zsh


# Prepend the source to the zshrc file
echo -e "source ~/.dotfiles/zshrc\nsource ~/.dotfiles/aliases\n$(cat ~/.zshrc)" > ~/.zshrc
```

### bash

In addition to sourcing the bash profile you have to source the `git-prompt-sh` script.

```sh
echo -e "source /usr/lib/git-core/git-sh-prompt\nsource ~/.dotfiles/bash_profile\nsource ~/dotifles/aliases\n$(cat ~/.bashrc)" > ~/.bashrc
```

If I use both shells on a machine, I like to put the shared env variables into a `~/.shell_shared` file.

### Tmux config

```bash
echo -e "source-file ~/.dotfiles/tmux.conf\n$(cat ~/.tmux.conf)" > ~/.tmux.conf
```
